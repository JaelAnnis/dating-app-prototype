# Dating App Prototype

A dating app that is designed to reduce superficial bias by blurring profile photos and only unblurring after a meaningful conversation has occurred. This project was self-taught for semester 4 in my computer programming course. It demonstrates my experience with Python, Django, SQLite, Model View Controllers, and database ORMs.
